# ReCal

<h1>Goal</h1>
<h3>Slack for Calendars. Encouraging productivity and continuity in our calendars</h3>

<p>Fundamental idea #1: meetings require as much, if not more continuity and organization than just P2P or P2Group communication, but right now most people just use hand-written notes.</p>

<p>Fundamental idea #2: many meetings are ill-prepared for or just shouldn't happen. How can we encourage behavior that would make a higher percentage of meetings worth having?</p>
